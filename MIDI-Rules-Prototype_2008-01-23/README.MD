MIDI Rules Protoype 2007-12-09
------------------------------

MIDI Rules is a Rule-Based MIDI Processing System that can process 
(translate, map, convert, filter, trigger, route) MIDI messages. 
It supports multiple MIDI inputs/outputs, variables (enables state-based processing)
and timed/delayed messages.

MIDI processing instructions are defined as set of rules, written in the MIDI Rule Language. 
MIDI Rules is a JAVA application and runs on almost any JAVA-enabled platform with midi support.

*** MIDI Rules requires a Java Runtime Environment (>=1.5) to run: http://www.java.com/download/

*** You will also need 'MIDI Yoke' (http://www.midiox.com) or 
*** alternatively 'Maple Virtual Midi Cable' (http://www.hurchalla.com/Maple_driver.html)
*** on MS Windows Platforms.

MIDI Rules is still under development. You will currently not find:
- A GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- A rule file editor (You have to use a Text Editor if you want to make changes)
